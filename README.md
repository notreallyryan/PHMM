In biological studies, proteins are often classified into different evolutionary families. Proteins in the same family share a common function and by extension, have similar amino acid sequences. 
As such, classifying a protein early is useful in the field, as it narrows down the characteristics of the protein, reducing the time and finances needed for lab work. While classification inevitably requires 
some lab work in order to confirm a protein's family, computational techniques can provide a good estimate of where to start.
